# Pipette-Deflection

This repository contains every Python script related to pipette deflection measurement. 

Some files contains functions that can be used in different situations. For example the function pippos is used in the calibration script but can be used to measure the deflection of a pipette in any experiment

Using these scripts/functions requires the following packages:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - skimage
  - cv2
  - math
  - scipy
  
Some of the scripts also use os and tkinter. These are optional if the directory and filenames are entered manually.
